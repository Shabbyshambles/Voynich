Notes:
Current approach:
Modeling sentences as graphs of probabilities, can a GNN crack the Voynich Manuscript if trained on grammars of other languages 
present in the same region and time period

Tasks:
Build a simple GNN to gain familiarity with the methodology using toy examples and easy graphs

Research era and location of discovery of Voynich Manuscript

Any languages found in that era/location that have known translations available online?

DL Voynich Manuscript full text

Concerns:
What if Manuscript text is not the location of its information? There exist pictures and other qualities that may be used to
convey information.

What if it uses a cypher to obscure grammatical elements?
